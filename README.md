DevilElevator
=============

Some java classes involving multi-threaded programming in java. The first one is EventBarrier and the second one is DevilElevator (a multi-threaded design capacble of simulating multiple elevators and riders in a building). My partner (Alex Milu) and I implemented these classes for an assignment for our course CS 310: Operating Systems at Duke University. If you are taking that course, please do not view the code. Please do not copy or use this code for any graded work.

The requirements for this assignment can be viewed in the lab3.pdf file. The README.txt document was also submitted to the graded and hold a bried overview of our methodology.
